 This check outputs the status and age of Proxmox VE guest backups done

 It reads all configs in the direcotry /etc/pve/qemu-server/.
 For each VM guest found a service is created. The service read all
 logfiles under /var/log/vzdump/ and parses it for WARN and ERROR entrys.
 Logs from Proxmox Backup Server backup processes also located in /var/log/vzdump/
 and are also checked.

 The {critical} and {warning} limits for the backup age can be configured in WATO.
 
 It's possible to check the runtime (duration) of the backup-process.
 In this time the checks stays {ok} if the backup task is currently running.
