description:
 This check runs on Proxmox Servers.

 It reads all configs in the direcotry /etc/pve/qemu-server/.
 For each VM guest found a service is created. The service read all
 logfiles under /var/log/vzdump/ and parses it.

 The default is that the service gets {critical} if no backup exists or the backup is
 older than 30 hours. It gets {warning} if the backup is older than 26 hours.
 
 The {critical} and {warning} limits can be configured in WATO.
 The check can also be disabled for a VM guest.
 It's possible to define the runtime (duration) of the backup-process.
 In this time the checks stays {ok} if the backup task is currently running.
 Goto WATO - Host & Service Parameters. Search for proxmox.

 Newly created VM guest are displayed as new service by the check_mk
 inventory check.
